# Automatic-Attendance-Marking-System-with-Hand-Sanitizer-Dispenser

## Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) revolutionizes the way devices communicate and interact without the need for constant human intervention. One prominent application of IoT is Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), where wireless microchips are used to tag objects for automatic identification.

In educational institutions like universities, managing attendance for a large number of students can be challenging. Traditional manual attendance systems involving sign-in sheets are time-consuming, prone to errors, and can compromise safety measures, especially during times like the COVID-19 pandemic.

To address these challenges, this project proposes a solution leveraging RFID technology to automate attendance recording and incorporate a hand sanitizer dispenser. By using RFID-enabled student ID cards and an RFID reader, this system offers a more efficient and reliable alternative to manual attendance processes.

## Features
- **Automated Attendance Recording**: The system utilizes RFID-enabled student ID cards to automatically record attendance upon entry.
- **Hand Sanitizer Integration**: Alongside attendance recording, the system includes an automatic hand sanitizer dispenser to promote hygiene and safety protocols.
- **Efficiency**: By automating the attendance process, the system reduces the time and effort required for manual attendance taking.
- **Accuracy**: RFID technology ensures accurate attendance recording, minimizing errors and discrepancies.
- **Safety Compliance**: With the integration of a hand sanitizer dispenser, the system promotes adherence to safety recommendations, particularly during health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.

## How to Use
1. **Hardware Setup**: Follow the provided circuit diagram and instructions to set up the RFID reader and hand sanitizer dispenser unit.
2. **Software Installation**: Download and install the necessary software components onto the designated devices(Arduino IDE), ensuring compatibility and proper configuration.
3. **RFID Tag Enrollment**: Register student ID cards as RFID tags within the system, assigning each card to its respective student.
4. **System Operation**: When students enter the premises, they present their RFID-enabled ID cards to the reader, which automatically records their attendance and dispenses hand sanitizer.
5. **Data Management**: Attendance data can be accessed and managed through the Google Sheet, providing insights into attendance trends and patterns.

## Repository Contents
